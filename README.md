# Project IRIS

This project is a chrome extension that serves to provide a text-to-speech option for any website. It primarily targets visually impaired as well as people with blindness.

This project uses the IBM Watson Text-to-Speech API.

Users are able to hover/tab to an element on a webpage, which will play an audio file that reads any text on an element. The extension will also translate text to a selected language, if the selected language is not English.
